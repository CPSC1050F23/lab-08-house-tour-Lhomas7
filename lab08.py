CODE DESCRIPTION:
This program models a person's text navigation through a fictional house.
The house has rooms stored in a dictionary that is modified and displayed by use of classes.
The user will select which room they would like to enter and the program will validate that 
the room is a potential exit, and will also take that user to that room.
